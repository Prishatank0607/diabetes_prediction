# Diabetes Prediction Web App

An interactive and user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The app allows users to input data, receive predictions, visualize the model output, and download results.

## About the Project

This project aims to make machine learning models accessible and interpretable by deploying them in an interactive frontend. It is designed as a two-page flow:
- Page 1: User inputs health data using sliders
- Page 2: Displays prediction results with probability breakdown, visualizations, and editing options

## Dataset Overview

The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which contains diagnostic measurements of female patients.

- **Total Samples:** 768  
- **Features:**
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age  
- **Target:** Binary outcome (1: Diabetic, 0: Not Diabetic)
